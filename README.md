# navBarExercise - Shopping Cart
In this exercise I am creating a shopping cart that requires  to write out all items with their names and stock number
- Each item requires a button and use onClick that moves 1 item into the Shopping Cart every time I click on the button.
- Code uses React.useState to keep track of items in the cart.
- After clicking an item, a new list is created under the shopping cart section.
